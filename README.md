# Dog Breed Classifier (Group 45)

## Installation

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create a Conda Environment**  
   ```bash
   conda create --name dogs python=3.10
   conda activate dogs
   ```
   This project has been tested with PyTorch 2.2.0 and CUDA 11.8.

2. **Install the Required Packages**

   First, install PyTorch manually according to your cuda version. For example, for CUDA 11.8:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch==2.2.0 torchvision==0.17.0 torchaudio==2.2.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```
   Then go on with the rest. To install the package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   Or either just the strict requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### Setting Up the Data

After setting up the environment, run `data.py` to process the data from the source:

```bash
python src/dog_breed_classifier/data.py
```
That will download the original dataset, preprocess it and save the train, test and validation datasets in the /data folder.

---

### Running Training Sessions

#### Building from scratch
In Linux, Git Bash, or WSL, you can build both the processed dataset and the model by running
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_all.sh
./scripts/run_all.sh
```

#### Train A Model Individually
To train a model on a specific configuration, run
```bash
python src/dog_breed_classifier/train.py local
```
You'll find the hyperparameters for a single training session in /config/config.yaml

To do the training with wandb, run it with the flag wandb-run

```bash
python src/dog_breed_classifier/train.py wandb-run
```

#### Parameter sweep
The config file with the setup can be found at /configs/sweep.yaml.
To run this session:

```bash
python src/dog_breed_classifier/train.py sweep
```


### Updating `requirements.txt`

To update the `requirements.txt` file based on your current environment:
1. Install `pipreqs`:
   ```bash
   pip install pipreqs
   ```
2. Generate an updated `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pipreqs . --force
   ```
3. When installing from source, bear in mind that the pytorch version will differ depending on the available hardware, preferrably delete it from requirements.txt and install it as explained before.


## Overall Goal
The goal of this project is to build a **dog breed classifier** capable of distinguishing between 120 different breeds as accurately as possible. The focus will be on achieving fine-grained classification by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and pretrained models.

## Framework
The project will be based on PyTorch and will leverage its ecosystem for efficient model development and experimentation:
- **Albumentations**: To perform advanced image augmentations and effectively extend the variability of the dataset, improving the model's generalization capabilities.
- **TIMM**: To access a variety of pretrained models and well-known architectures, enabling faster development and more accurate predictions.

## Data
The dataset used will be the Stanford Dogs Dataset, which contains:
- **120** dog breeds.
- **20,580** images, with approximately 150 images per breed.
The images are of varying resolutions and backgrounds, representing real-world diversity.
- **Challenge**: The dataset requires distinguishing subtle differences between breeds, often with high inter-class similarity and low intra-class variability.
**Preprocessing** will include resizing images to a uniform resolution, applying Albumentations-based augmentations (e.g., cropping, flipping, color jittering), and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

## Models
The project will primarily explore pretrained Resnet variants, which will be fine-tuned to perform an accurate classification of the different existing dog breeds.
